# 📚 Semantic Book Recommender

Semantic Book Recommender is an interactive AI-powered web application that helps users discover books tailored to their interests, genres, and emotional tone. Leveraging modern NLP embeddings and vector search (ChromaDB), it provides recommendations based on the *meaning* of your query, not just keywords.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Semantic Search:** Find books by describing your ideal story in natural language.
- **Emotion Filtering:** Filter recommendations by mood (Happy, Surprising, Angry, Suspenseful, Sad).
- **Category Selection:** Choose from a wide range of genres.
- **Interactive UI:** Clean, modern Gradio interface with instant results and example queries.
- **Image Gallery:** See book covers and short descriptions for each recommendation.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Data Loading:**  
   Loads book metadata (ISBN, title, authors, categories, emotion scores, image URLs) from a CSV file.

2. **Embedding & Vector Store:**  
   Book descriptions are embedded using a SentenceTransformer model (`BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`). Embeddings are stored and queried using ChromaDB[2].

3. **User Query:**  
   Users enter a description, select a category and mood, and submit their request.

4. **Semantic Retrieval:**  
   The app performs a similarity search in the vector database to find books whose descriptions best match the user's query[2].

5. **Filtering & Ranking:**  
   Results are filtered by category and sorted by the selected emotional tone.

6. **Display:**  
   The top recommendations are shown in a gallery with cover images and truncated descriptions[1].
